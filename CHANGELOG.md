## 2.0.0-alpha.0 - 2020-03-19

Refactors:

- The whole part of schemas and attribute definitions was refactored
- Tests are now run by Jest (and Electron for browser tests)
- Prettier was added
- Move to mono-repo

Enhancements

- Implement jest-structure assertions
- It's possible to set custom getters e setters directly in the structure class

Breaking changes:

- Joi is updated to v16
  - Attribute path in validation _errors_ is an array instead of a string
  - Attribute path in validation _messages_ contains the whole path joined by '.'
  - The name used for the dynamic import should aways be the same as the name of its type or else a custom identifier must be used
- Non-nullable attributes with value null will use default value the same way undefined does
- Structure classes now have two methods to generically set and get the value of the attributes, `.get(attributeName)` and `.set(attributeName, attributeValue)`
- Minimum Node version is now 10
